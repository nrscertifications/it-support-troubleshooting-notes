# IT Support & Help Desk Knowledge Base

## Overview

This repository contains standardized troubleshooting runbooks and incident-style documentation for common IT Support and Help Desk scenarios.

The purpose of this knowledge base is to document clear triage steps, likely causes, remediation actions, verification checks, and support handoff notes. The examples demonstrate practical troubleshooting judgment, clear escalation boundaries, and repeatable technical handoffs rather than command-only fixes.

---

## Documentation Standards

Each runbook follows a consistent support format:

* **Incident Summary:** Clear description of the reported issue and affected environment.
* **Triage & Symptoms:** Observable symptoms, user impact, and initial checks.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** Likely cause or confirmed fault where available.
* **Remediation Steps:** Safe, ordered troubleshooting actions.
* **Verification & Post-Incident Review:** How the fix was confirmed and what should be documented for future prevention.

The focus is on non-destructive troubleshooting, clear documentation, and realistic support escalation language.

## Core Competencies Demonstrated

* Documented real-world style support scenarios using structured runbook formatting.
* Practiced symptom isolation before applying fixes or escalating.
* Used non-destructive triage steps to protect user data and system stability.
* Wrote remediation steps that can be followed by another support technician.
* Included verification steps so incidents are not closed without proof of resolution.
* Organized technical documentation in a GitHub repository for portfolio review.
